# AdelphiFallArts2020
Fall Arts Fest Digital Imaging Project - September 2020
Inspired by contemporary artists, such as Krzysztof Wodiczko and Shimon Attie, and Adelphi University’s Voters Rights initiative, students in Professor Allen’s fall 2020 Digital Imaging class created installation proposals for and visual/audio renderings of campus sites. In three weeks time, individual students photographed the campus, sampled and recorded sounds, and created rough Photoshop renderings. We invite you to click on the campus map to view each student’s proposal and imagine Adelphi’s campus illuminated by visions and sounds of the past.
