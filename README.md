# Fall Arts Fest Digital Imaging Project - September 2020 #
Inspired by contemporary artists, such as Krzysztof Wodiczko and Shimon Attie, and Adelphi University’s Voters Rights Initiative, students in Professor Allen’s Fall 2020 Digital Imaging class created campus installation proposals that included visual renderings and sound compositions. In three weeks time, individual students photographed the campus, sampled, recorded, and edited sounds, and created rough, conceptual Photoshop renderings. This first Digital Imaging assignment of the semester challenged art students to imagine multimedia installations. Over the coming months, these students will refine their software and computer skills. We invite you to click on the campus map to view each student’s proposal and imagine Adelphi’s campus illuminated by visions and sounds of the past.
