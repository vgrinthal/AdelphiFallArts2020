     <figcaption style="background-color:#ffb500;"><p style="font-size: 30px; font-family: sans-serif;">Swirbul Library, back fountain - Created by Jay Peierls</p><p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: sans-serif;">On the left of the image are three men throwing the ballots, tally sheets and poll books of the Newberry election of 1918 into a furnace at the U.S. Capitol Power House- they were ordered to be burned by Federal Judge Tuttle of Detroit.</p>
 
<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: sans-serif;">Next to the ballot burners is a brick wall standing in the water, in which a man is about to cross a trench  in front of the concentration camp at Kharkov in order to help Bolshevists. The story is that,  “Along the cement pathway which crosses the photograph there appeared one day three representatives of the labor union at Kharkov. The unionists had voted to plead with the ‘extraordinary council’  of the commune for less drastic measures in overcoming the sentiment against Bolshevism. The three delegates came unarmed and with the most peaceful intention. Without warning the guards of the concentration camp shot them as they crossed this bridge over the trench and they fell into the pit.” </p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: sans-serif;">Below this moment in the water, is a line of black women waiting on line to vote in the 40s, a time in which they still struggled to vote because of racist laws. Slightly covering  the efforts of the black women are three white suffragettes that would have gotten to vote much earlier.
